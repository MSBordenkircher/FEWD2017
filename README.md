## Thank you for coming to check out my prokect!

This website was designed for a fictional ice cream shop. I used ice cream as my sbuject so that I could play with bright, fun colors and more of a bubbly feel. As with ice cream, my site has round feel to it as compared to more modern, blocky sites.

## Design Structure

Most of the site was puilt with custom CSS, Bootstrap 4 was used for a few buttons and for a grid on the home page. I've also implemented JavaScript on the flavors page to display an information block whenever you select an ice cream flavor.

## Responsivness

Through using Bootstrap 4 my homepage flexes with the window. Using custom CSS I have made this site responsive up to 4k *though not fully tested because I don't own a 4k viewport*.
